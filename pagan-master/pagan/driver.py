# Import the pagan module.

# Use pagan to generate an avatar object based on an input string.
# Optional: You may specify which hash function Pagan should use.
# The functions are available as constants.
# Default: MD5.
img = pagan.Avatar(inpt)

# Open the avatar image in an
# external image viewer.
img.show()

# Set an output path and a file name.
# You don't need to specify a file ending.
# Choose a path depending on your OS.
outpath = 'output/'
filename = inpt

# Saves the avatar image as a .png file
# by omitting the path and name. The
# file endings will be generated automatically.
img.save(outpath, filename)

# You can change the avatar input and
# hash function anytime.
img.change('new input', pagan.SHA256)
